Everything in this repository, not including this README.md file but including the README file, is downloaded from Donald Knuth's website at https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html

They seem to be from [SAILDART](https://www.saildart.org/), and contain some HTML escaping and the like. Some cleanup is possible. Will do sometime.

Note that SAIL used a different character set with a different set of characters, which the maintainer of SAIL has converted to Unicode. You can see some details of what I could figure out, [elsewhere](https://github.com/shreevatsa/tex/tree/master/history/saildart). In principle one could write a SAIL emulator (maybe), to run these programs, but they are otherwise not usable.

Also, SAILDART has a few more versions than just the two that are currently in the repo. Might be an interesting "software archaeology" project to match up whatever is available against Knuth's [errorlog](http://texdoc.net/pkg/errorlog).
